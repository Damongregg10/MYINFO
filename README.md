## My Coding Projects  

Here are some of the projects I have worked on. They are very simple but works in progress:

---

### [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Damongregg10/Python_Repo/blob/main/fizz_buzz.py)
- **Description:** My implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem. It took some time to get right, but mastering it was essential as it demonstrates a foundational programming concept: how code executes sequentially from top to bottom.

### [Calculator](https://github.com/Damongregg10/Python_Repo/blob/main/calculator.py)
- **Description:** A collection of basic calculator programs I made while learning to code. These include adding numbers, rounding results, and even squaring a number using a simple function. Each version helped me understand how to work with inputs, different number types, and formatting outputs.

### [Cat Image Generator](https://github.com/Damongregg10/Python_Repo/blob/main/Cat%20_Image_Generator.py)
- **Description:** Who doesn't love cats? This project randomly selects and displays one of three funny cat images. Using some basic Python magic (and a little help from ChatGPT), it combines randomness and the Python Image Library (Pillow).
